The exponential growth of published information presents significant challenges in managing and extracting meaningful insights from unstructured data. 
Named Entity Recognition (NER) plays a critical role in transforming such data into structured, machine-readable formats by identifying and categorizing named entities into predefined semantic classes. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a memory-based NER framework tailored for Kikuyu, a low-resource Bantu language. Leveraging the TiMBL (Tilburg Memory-Based Learner) algorithm, implementing KNN with k=1, the research implemented a k-nearest neighbor approach to classify entities based on manually annotated data from the Kikuyu Bible corpus. The methodology incorporated quality control measures such as inter-annotator agreement and cross-validation to ensure reliability. Experimental results demonstrated promising performance, achieving 72.54% Precision, 72.67% Recall, and a 72.5% F-score. These findings underscore the viability of memory-based learning for NER in resource-scarce languages and contribute a novel annotated Kikuyu corpus and framework for future linguistic and NLP applications.
